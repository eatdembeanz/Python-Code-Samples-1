# Python-Code-Samples-1
A collection of small, specific programs for practice purposes.

In this portfolio are three programs. 
Program 2 simply asks the user for their name, and uses it in a sentence. Program 3 is an evolution from Program 2, since it now adds a "wrong" answer to the question it asks. If the right username is input, it uses it in a sentence; if not, it doesn't!

Program 4 gives you a way to see what day you'll come back when you go on a vacation. It asks for the day you start and how many days you'll be spending on holiday, then calculates what day of the week you'll be back by.
